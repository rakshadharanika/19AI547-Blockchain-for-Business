# Experiment 2: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)
## Name   : V Raksha Dharanika
## Reg no : 212223230167
## Aim:
To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.

## Algorithm:

1.The project creator deploys a smart contract, setting a funding goal and deadline.

2.The contract initializes variables to track contributions and campaign status.

3.Contributors send ETH to the contract before the deadline.

4.Each contribution is recorded along with the contributorâ€™s address.

5.The contract keeps track of the total amount raised.

6.If the funding goal is reached before the deadline, the campaign is marked successful.

7.After a successful campaign, the creator can withdraw the funds.

8.If the goal is not met by the deadline, contributors can claim refunds.

contract Crowdfunding {
    struct Campaign {
        address creator;
        uint256 goal;
        uint256 deadline;
        uint256 amountRaised;
        bool goalMet;
        mapping(address => uint256) contributions;
    }

    Campaign public campaign;

    constructor(uint256 _goal, uint256 _duration) {
        campaign.creator = msg.sender;
        campaign.goal = _goal;
        campaign.deadline = block.timestamp + _duration;
    }

    function contribute() public payable {
        require(block.timestamp < campaign.deadline, "Campaign ended");
        campaign.amountRaised += msg.value;
        campaign.contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == campaign.creator, "Only creator can withdraw");
        require(campaign.amountRaised >= campaign.goal, "Goal not met");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(campaign.amountRaised);
        campaign.goalMet = true;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(block.timestamp > campaign.deadline, "Campaign still active");
        require(campaign.amountRaised < campaign.goal, "Goal was met");
        uint256 amount = campaign.contributions[msg.sender];
        campaign.contributions[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```
# Expected Output:

Users can contribute ETH to the campaign.
If the goal is met, the creator can withdraw funds.
If the goal is not met, contributors can claim a refund.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches decentralized fundraising.


Avoids fraud by ensuring funds are only transferred if the goal is met.

# RESULT: 
Thus,a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.
